\chapter{Introduction}
The storage capacity for a given cost is increasing exponentially \cite{wiki:krydr}.
This tendency allows us to store information at low cost.Furthermore, services like the WWW
resulted accelerated communication patterns in a highly connected human society. As a
result, accessing information at no cost become a standard in the 21st century. However,
for a given person, the amount of reachable information is too large. In the age of big
data, users of the WWW are flooded by accessibleinformation. Services like search engines
and recommender systems serve to filter for the given user the available information, and
only retrieve relevant information for her. 


Recommender systems are able to solve this problem by filtering items and recommend the 
suitable ones to users. Recommender systems can  also predict user-item interactions and
the  user behavior. These systems are used by online companies/providers/websites to improve the users satisfaction and to increase the number of users in the same time.
