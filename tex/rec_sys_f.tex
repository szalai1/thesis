\chapter{Recommender Systems}
Recommender systems can score or order the users' oportunities to help them to
make the choice with the higher satisfaction rate. We are not capable to measure
the users satisfaction rate directly, that's why we use distinct evaluation functions
to estimate it.

In this section we will talk about collaborative filtering, where we will use the
information of other users' preference to recommend. After that we will see another
approace, where we will use informations about items and users preferences to recommend
items to users.
