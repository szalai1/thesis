\chapter{Context-aware recommendation}
\begin{itemize}
\item Relevance the music recommendation
\item Music related data has several interesting features
  \begin{itemize}
  \item genre
  \item tag
  \item playlist
  \item artist
  \item album
  \end{itemize}
\item Music sessions are highly temporal behavings, that's why we use online
  algorithms
\item nmusic
\item streaming feasibility
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Attribute based recommendation}
\begin{itemize}
\item We would have liked to use the track features
\item Our basic modell is $r_t = q_u \sum_{j\in\mathcal{F}_t}p_j$, where $\mathcal{F}_t$ is the feature set of the track $t$
\end{itemize}
